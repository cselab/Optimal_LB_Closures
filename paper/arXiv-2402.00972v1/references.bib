abstract = {Systematic collection of predictions of research findings can provide many benefits Many fields of research, such as economics, psychology, political science, and medicine, have seen growing interest in new research designs to improve the rigor and credibility of research (e.g., natural experiments, lab experiments, and randomized controlled trials). Interest has similarly grown in efforts to increase transparency, such as preregistration of hypotheses and methods, that seek to allay concerns that improved research designs do not address per se, such as publication bias and p-hacking. Yet, although these efforts improve the informativeness and interpretation of research results, relatively little attention has been paid to another practice that could help to achieve this goal: relating research findings to the views of the scientific community, policy-makers, and the general public. We suggest below three broad ways in which systematic collection of predictions of research results will prove useful: by improving the interpretation of research results, mitigating bias against null results, and improving predictive accuracy and experimental design.}}

abstract = {Crashing ocean waves, cappuccino froths, and microfluidic bubble crystals are examples of foamy flows. Foamy flows are critical in numerous natural and industrial processes and remain notoriously difficult to compute as they involve coupled, multiscale physical processes. Computations need to resolve the interactions of the bubbles separated by stable thin liquid films. We present the multilayer volume-of-fluid method (Multi-VOF) that advances the state of the art in simulation capabilities of foamy flows. The method introduces a scheme to handle multiple bubbles that do not coalesce. Multi-VOF is verified and validated with experimental results and complemented with open-source software. We demonstrate capturing of crystalline structures of bubbles in realistic microfluidics devices and foamy flows involving tens of thousands of bubbles in a waterfall. The present technique extends the classical volume-of-fluid methodology and allows for large-scale predictive simulations of flows with multiple interfaces. Numerical method Multi-VOF describes flows with thousands of noncoalescing bubbles that turn into foam}}



@article{MARLGronauer,
	abstract = {The advances in reinforcement learning have recorded sublime success in various domains. Although the multi-agent domain has been overshadowed by its single-agent counterpart during this progress, multi-agent reinforcement learning gains rapid traction, and the latest accomplishments address problems with real-world complexity. This article provides an overview of the current developments in the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. We focus primarily on literature from recent years that combines deep reinforcement learning methods with a multi-agent scenario. To survey the works that constitute the contemporary landscape, the main contents are divided into three parts. First, we analyze the structure of training schemes that are applied to train multiple agents. Second, we consider the emergent patterns of agent behavior in cooperative, competitive and mixed scenarios. Third, we systematically enumerate challenges that exclusively arise in the multi-agent domain and review methods that are leveraged to cope with these challenges. To conclude this survey, we discuss advances, identify trends, and outline possible directions for future work in this research area.},

abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluids plays an essential role in modeling many physical phenomena, such as weather, climate, aerodynamics, and plasma physics. Fluids are well described by the Navier–Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10× finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.}}

abstract = {The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is challenging because of the need to resolve spatiotemporal features over wide length- and timescales. Often, it is computationally intractable to resolve the finest features in the solution. The only recourse is to use approximate coarse-grained representations, which aim to accurately represent long-wavelength dynamics while properly accounting for unresolved small-scale physics. Deriving such coarse-grained equations is notoriously difficult and often ad hoc. Here we introduce data-driven discretization, a method for learning optimized approximations to PDEs based on actual solutions to the known underlying equations. Our approach uses neural networks to estimate spatial derivatives, which are optimized end to end to best satisfy the equations on a low-resolution grid. The resulting numerical methods are remarkably accurate, allowing us to integrate in time a collection of nonlinear equations in 1 spatial dimension at resolutions 4× to 8× coarser than is possible with standard finite-difference methods.}}

In our benchmark experiments the resulting online learning algorithms converge orders of magnitude faster than ordinary stochastic gradient descent.},

    abstract = { This paper provides a review and commentary on the past, present, and future of numerical optimization algorithms in the context of machine learning applications. Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations. }

@conference{attention_bahdanau,
title = "Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate",
abstract = "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder?decoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder?decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.",

abstract = {We present Korali, an open-source framework for large-scale Bayesian uncertainty quantification and stochastic optimization. The framework relies on non-intrusive sampling of complex multiphysics models and enables their exploitation for optimization and decision-making. In addition, its distributed sampling engine makes efficient use of massively-parallel architectures while introducing novel fault tolerance and load balancing mechanisms. We demonstrate these features by interfacing Korali with existing high-performance software such as Aphros, LAMMPS (CPU-based), and Mirheo (GPU-based) and show efficient scaling for up to 512 nodes of the CSCS Piz Daint supercomputer. Finally, we present benchmarks demonstrating that Korali outperforms related state-of-the-art software frameworks.}

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

Since solutions to such problems do not depend on the order of elements of the set, models used to address them should be permutation invariant. We present an attention-based neural network module, the Set Transformer, specifically designed to model interactions among elements in the input set. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which rely on attention mechanisms. In an effort to reduce computational complexity, we introduce an attention scheme inspired by inducing point methods from sparse Gaussian process literature. It reduces the computation time of self-attention from quadratic to linear in the number of elements in the set. We show that our model is theoretically attractive and we evaluate it on a range of tasks, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods for set-structured data.}

Especially with the hardware integration of low-precision special-function units designed for machine learning applications, the traditional numerical algorithms community urgently needs to reconsider the floating point formats used in the distinct operations to efficiently leverage the available compute power. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of mixed-precision numerical linear algebra routines, including the underlying concepts, theoretical background, and experimental results for both dense and sparse linear algebra problems.}
